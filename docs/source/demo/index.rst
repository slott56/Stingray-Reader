Perhaps the most important use case for **Stingray** is to write data extract
applications. This is shown below in :ref:`demo_validate`. 
We can also handle COBOL file conversions. This is shown below in :ref:`demo_cobol`.

Additionally, we can use **Stingray** to provide
assurance that  our files and our applications both use the
same conceptual schema. We need several kinds of assurance.

-   How do we **confirm** the schema of a given file? 

-   More importantly, how do we confirm that an application can successfully use a file?
