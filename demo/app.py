# Application Level Data Validation Technique
# ##########################################################
#
# We validate that that a file actually matches a schema through a three-part valiation process.  
# We looked at the first two parts in :ref:`demo_sqa`.
#
# -   Validate an application's use of a schema via conventional unit testing.
#
# -   Validate file conformance to a schema via "live-file testing".
#
# In this section we'll show how to include 
# a **File Validation** mode in every file processing application.  
#
# Having a validation mode means that we must disentangle all of the persistent state change 
# operations from the input and processing in our application.  
# The "normal" mode uses persistent changes based on the output.
# The validation mode doesn't make persistent changes;
# it can be viewed as a sort of "dry run": all the processing; none of the writing.
#
# We'll do this with a combination of the **Command** and the **Strategy** design patterns.
# We'll create applications
# which validate their input file and have a simple plug-in strategy for 
# doing any final persistent processing on that file.
#
# ..  note:: Simple File Structures
#
#     This validation is designed for simple CSV files with embedded schema.
#     The assumption is that each sheet within the workbook
#     has a consistent structure. There's no filter applied to pass
#     or reject sheets.
#            
#     Some kind of extension to this application is required
#     to handle named sheets within a more complex workbook or 
#     to handle sheets which have no header.
#
# State Change Commands
# =======================
#
# The **Command** design patterns is helpful for isolating state changes in an application.
#
# Each change (create, update, delete) creates a **Command**.  
# In validate mode, these are created but not applied. 
# In "normal" processing mode, these are created and applied.
#
# For Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) applications, the commands are the loads.
#
# For create-retrieve-update-delete (CRUD) programs, the commands are variations on create, update and delete.
#
# For data warehouse dimensional conformance applications, the 
# command may be a slowly-changing dimension (SCD) algorithm that does insert
# or update (or both) into a dimension table.
#
# For applications that involve a (potentially) complex multi-step workflow with
# (potentially) several state changes along the way, each change is a command.
#
# In some cases, a fairly sophisticated **Command** class hierarchy is
# called for.  In other cases, however, the individual commands can be
# merged into the validate **Strategy** object as methods.
#
# Persistence Context Manager
# =============================
#
# One good way to distinguish between persistent and transient processing 
# is to use a **Strategy** class hierarchy.
# This will have two variations on the persistent state changes.
#
# -   **Validate**.  This subclass does nothing.
#
# -   **Process**.  This subclass actually makes persistent state changes.
#
# Combining the validate **Strategy** with the state change **Command** 
# leads to class similar to the following.
#
# The superclass does the persistent processing. This is the "normal" mode
# that makes proper changes to the filesystem or database.
#
# ..  parsed-literal::
#
#     class Persistent_Processing:
#         stop_on_exception= True
#         def __init__( self, context ):
#             self.context= context
#         def save_this( self, this_instance ):
#             this_instance.save()
#         def save_that( self, this_instance ):
#             that_instance.save()
#
# We'll fold in the Context Manager interface.  This is a polite way to support
# any preparation or finalization.  For example, we would use the context manager
# to create database connections, or finalize file system operations, etc.
#
# ..  parsed-literal::
#
#         def __enter__( self ):
#             return self
#         def __exit__( self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb ):
#             if exc_type is not None: return False
#     
# Here's a subclass which implements a safe, do-nothing strategy.  This 
# is used for "validate-mode" processing. It's a subclass that turns off
# persistence.
#       
# ..  parsed-literal::
#
#     class Validate_Only_Processing( Persistent_Processing ):
#         stop_on_exception= False
#         def __init__( self, context ):
#             self.context= context
#         def save_this( self, this_instance ):
#             pass
#         def save_that( self, this_instance ):
#             pass
#
# ..      note:: Alternate Design
#
#         We could revise this design to make the validation mode the superclass.
#         The subclass could then add the persistence features.
#        
#         This doesn't actually work out well in practice.
#        
#         Why not?
#        
#         It's too easy to overlook things in the validation mode superclass.
#         The normal persistent processing subclass then winds up having a **lot** of extra 
#         stuff added to it.
#        
#         The design winds up somewhat better looking if we remove persistence.
#        
# Having these two classes allows us to configure our 
# application processing as follows. We can define high-level functions
# like :py:func:`validate` and :py:func:`process` that are identical
# except for the context manager that's used.
#
# ..  parsed-literal::
#
#     def validate( sheet, some_context ):
#         with Validate_Only_Processing( some_context ) as mode:
#             counts= process_sheet( sheet, mode )
#         return counts
#
#     def process( sheet, some_context ):        
#         with Persistent_Processing( some_context ) as mode:
#             counts= process_sheet( sheet, mode )
#         return counts
#
# Both of these :py:func:`validate` and :py:func:`process` functions
# rely on a common :py:func:`process_sheeet`. This is agnostic of the
# processing context; it simply does its work.
#
# ..  parsed-literal::
#
#     def process_sheet( sheet, persistence ):
#         for row in sheet.schema.rows_as_dict_iter(sheet):
#             try:
#                 this= build_this( row )
#                 f= ThisForm( this )
#                 if f.is_valid():
#                     persistence.save_this( this )
#             except Exception, e:
#                 if persistence.stop_on_exception: raise
#                
# This allows us to effectively unit test by creating a 
# mock version of ``Persistent_Processing`` and invoking
# the ``process_sheet`` function.
#
# Example Application
# =======================
#
# We depend on a number of Python libraries.  Plus, of course, we're
# creating workbooks, working with sheets and schema.
#
# ::

import logging
import sys
import argparse
import pprint
from collections import defaultdict

import stingray.workbook
import stingray.sheet
import stingray.schema

logger= logging.getLogger( __name__ )

# ORM Layer
# ---------
#
# We'll often have an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer.
# These are components that are widely shared.  They could be SQLAlchemy 
# mapped class or a Django ORM class.  
#
# It's appropriate to supplement the ORM with a "Form" that
# follows the Django design pattern. This is a class that is used for validating 
# and creating model instances.
#
# Here's our fake model object, :py:class:`This`, and it's form, :py:class:`ThisForm`.
#
# ::

class This:
    def __init__( self, key, value ):
        self.key, self.value= key, value
    def save( self ):
        pass # The ORM save operation
        
class ThisForm:
    def __init__( self, **kw ):
        self.clean= kw
    def is_valid( self ):
        return self.clean['key'] is not None
    def save( self ):
        return This( **self.clean )

# We need to be sure that the ORM's save operation is only invoked through our persistence
# processing **Strategy** object.  With some libraries the persistence can 
# be implicit, making it difficult to assure that persistence is disabled properly.  
#
# There are a number of ways to handle implicit persistence in ORM layers.
# It may be necessary to provide a mock database "engine" or interface 
# in order to disable persistence.
#
# Persistence Context Manager
# ----------------------------
#
# These two classes define our two modes: validation and normal operations.
# The superclass defines the normal processing mode: we actually save objects.
# The subclass defines validation-only mode: we don't save anything.
#
# ::

class Persistent_Processing:
    stop_on_exception= True
    def save_this( self, this_instance ):
        this_instance.save()
    def __enter__( self ):
        return self
    def __exit__( self, exc_type, exc_val, exc_tb ):
        if exc_type is not None: return False
                        
class Validate_Only_Processing( Persistent_Processing ):
    stop_on_exception= False
    def save_this( self, this_instance ):
        pass

# In larger and more sophisticated applications, there may be a much more
# complex set of class definitions to enable or disable persistence.
#
# Builder Functions
# -----------------
#
# See :ref:`developer` for background. We're going to need a "builder function."
# This transforms the source row object into the target object or collection.
#
# To handle variant logical layouts, a number of builder functions are provided
# to map the logical schemata to a more standardized conceptual schema.
#
# ::
        
def builder_1( row ):
    return dict( 
        key= row['Column "3" - string'].to_str(),
        value= row['Col 2.0 - float'].to_float()
    )
    
def builder_2( row ):
    return dict( 
        key= row['Column 3'].to_str(),
        value= row['Column 2'].to_float()
    )
    
# Note that these builder functions are frequently added to. It's rare to get these 
# down to a single version that always works.
#
# Consequently, it's important to always **add** new builder functions.  Logical layouts are a
# moving target.  Old layouts don't go away; making changes to a builder is a bad idea.
#
# It helps to have a function like this to map argument values to a builder function.
#
# ::

def make_builder( args ):
    return {
            '1': builder_1,
            '2': builder_2
            }[args.layout]

# It can help to have a better naming convention that "_1" and "_2".  In practice,
# however, it's sometimes hard to determine why a logical layout changed, making
# it hard to assign a meaningful name to the layout.
#
# Processing
# ------------
#
# See :ref:`developer` for background. We're going to need a "sheet process function."
# This transforms the source sheet into the target collection, usually an output file.
#
# The :py:func:`process_sheet` function is the heart of the application.
# This handles all the rows present in a given sheet.
#
# ::

def process_sheet( sheet, builder, persistence ):
    counts= defaultdict( int )
    if sheet.schema is None:
        # Empty sheet -- no embedded schema
        return counts
    for source_row in sheet.schema.rows_as_dict_iter(sheet):
        try:
            counts['read'] += 1
            row_dict= builder( source_row )
            f= ThisForm( **row_dict )
            if f.is_valid():
                counts['processed'] += 1
                this= f.save()
                persistence.save_this( this )
            else:
                counts['rejected'] += 1
        except Exception as e:
            counts['invalid'] += 1
            if persistence.stop_on_exception: raise
            summary= "{0} {1!r}".format( e.__class__.__name__, e.args )
            logger.error( summary )
            counts['error',summary] += 1
    return counts
    
# Some applications will have variant processing for workbooks that
# contain different types of sheets. 
# This leads to different :py:func:`process_this_sheet` and :py:func:`process_that_sheet` functions. 
# Each will follow the above template to process all rows of the sheet.
#
# High-Level Interfaces
# ------------------------
#
# These are the functions that can be used for live-file unit testing
# of the application as a whole. The :py:func:`validate` function
# uses a context manager for validation only. The :py:func:`process` function
# uses the other context manager to that actual work is performed.

        counts= process_sheet( sheet, builder, mode )

    with Persistent_Processing() as mode:
        counts= process_sheet( sheet, builder, mode )

# These higher-level functions share a common :py:func:`process_workbook`
# function that does the real work.
