# Fixed-Format (COBOL-style) Workbook
# ------------------------------------
#
# Like a CSV workbook, this is a kind of degenerate case.  We don't have
# a lot of sheets, or a lot of data types.
#
# A subclass might do EBCDIC conversion and possibly even decode
# packed decimal numbers.  To do this, a COBOL-language DDE would be
# required as the schema definition. See :ref:`cobol`.
