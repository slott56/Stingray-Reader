# Sheet Module -- Sheet and Row Access
# ######################################
#
# ..  py:module:: sheet
#
# A *Sheet* is a generator
# of *Row* objects.  A *Row* is a sequence of :py:class:`cell.Cell` instances, 
# identified by position within the row.
#
# We have three variations on :py:class:`sheet.Sheet`.
#
# -   A simple :py:class:`sheet.Sheet`  lacks a schema.
#     (This corresponds with :py:func:`csv.reader`.)
#     For workbooks with a well-known physical format, the schema can be optional.
#     Each :py:class:`sheet.Row` object can be built eagerly and accessed
#     by position.
#
# -   A sheet with a schema.  There are two variations.
#
#     -   :py:class:`sheet.EmbeddedSchemaSheet` contains a schema.
#         This could be a simple as column titles in the first row.
#         (This corresponds to :py:class:`csv.DictReader`.)
#         Or it could be considerably more complex.
#
#     -   :py:class:`sheet.ExternalSchemaSheet` requires an external schema.
#         This schema may be simply a list of column titles supplied externally.
#         More often, the schema is a complete physical format description for
#         Fixed or COBOL format files.
#
# A known physical format (like a workbook) can build :py:class:`sheet.Row` objects eagerly with or without a schema.
# In the case of COBOL and fixed-format files, however, a :py:class:`sheet.Row`
# cannot be built eagerly.  It must be a lazy
# object which only builds :py:class:`cell.Cell` as needed.
# See :ref:`cobol` for details.
#
# Get Embedded Schema Use Case
# ===============================
#
# For an :py:class:`sheet.EmbeddedSchemaSheet`, the application (or Workbook) must 
# do a three-step dance to get the data using schema that is embedded in the sheet.
#
# 1.  Build a :py:class:`sheet.EmbeddedSchemaSheet` with an
#     "embedded schema loader" class.  (For example, :py:class:`schema.loader.HeadingRowSchemaLoader`.)
#     The loader partitions rows into two sets: header and data.
#
# 2.  Load the schema from the sheet.
#     The :py:class:`sheet.Sheet` will build an object of the loader class and use it to 
#     gather the schema information.
#     The schema loading may involve skipping irrelevant rows or
#     combining multi-line headings or anything else required to parse the schema.
#
# 3.  Get the rows from the sheet.
#     This will, also, invoke the attached loader to filter rows so that the header is not seen as data.
#
# The code might look like this:
#
# ..  parsed-literal::
#
#     with *open* as wb:
#         sheet = EmbeddedSchemaSheet( workbook, 'Sheet1', HeadingRowSchemaLoader )
#         counts= process_sheet( sheet )
#         pprint.pprint( counts )
#       
# The idea is to simply access a sheet with column titles, no matter how complex
# the column titles turn out to be.
#
# Get External Schema Use Case
# ===============================
#
# For an :py:class:`sheet.ExternalSchemaSheet`, the application (or Workbook) 
# must do a four-step dance to get data using schema.
#
# 1.  Build a :py:class:`schema.loader.ExternalSchemaLoader` as a schema loader.
#     This loader will require a source workbook, sheet name and a reader object.
#
# 2.  Get the Schema object from the loader.
#
# 3.  Build a :py:class:`sheet.ExternalSchemaSheet` with the Schema object.
#
# 4.  Get the rows from the sheet.
#
# And yes, the external source, is another
# spreadsheet!  Worse, the external source could be a fixed file or workbook
# for which a meta-schema is required to read the schema.
#
# The code might look like this:
#
# ..  parsed-literal::
#
#     with *open schema* as swb:
#         esl = ExternalSchemaLoader( swb, sheet_name='Schema' )
#         schema = esl.load()
#     with *open data* as wb:
#         sheet = ExternalSchemaSheet( wb, 'Sheet1', schema )
#         counts= process_sheet( sheet )
#         pprint.pprint( counts )
#
# The idea is to get a schema and then use the schema to access data.
#
#
# Get Rows Use Case
# ======================
#
# The essential job of a :py:class:`sheet.Sheet` is to produce :py:class:`sheet.Row` instances.  
# A row is a sequence of :py:class:`cell.Cell` instances.
#
# Note that :py:mod:`csv` is eager about building a row from the source data.
# This isn't universally appropriate.  COBOL files require lazy construction
# of the row's cells.
#
# A :py:class:`schema.Schema` can transform a sequence row into a dictionary row
# or a named tuple row.
# The :py:attr:`schema.Attribute.name` becomes the key for this row-as-dictionary.
#
# We specifically delegate the row-as-dictionary interpretation to the :py:class:`schema.Schema`,
# and avoid doing it in the :py:class:`sheet.Sheet`.  This is because most
# workbook schemata are flat.  However, a COBOL schema can have a very complex
# structure, making the row-as-dictionary too simplistic to be useful.
#
# As noted above, there are two candidate implementations of a Row.
#
# -   **Eager**.  Appropriate for most (but not all) Physical Formats.  The
#     idea is to apply the schema immediately to create the row as a
#     tuple of cells.  :py:mod:`csv` does this, and it can be applied to
#     other workbook formats.  It can be applied to simple, flat
#     Fixed format files.
#
# -   **Lazy**.  This is more appropriate for Fixed format files and COBOL format
#     files.  Specifically, the data conversion, redefines and repeating group
#     issues force us to wait for cell access rather than immediately create all
#     possible cells.  Indeed, for  COBOL files with REDEFINES definitions,
#     some of the cells cannot be built eagerly; application logic must determine
#     which attributes are valid or invalid.
#   
# Note that the API is the same. The implementation differs.
#
# Here's our prototypical code.
#
# ..  parsed-literal::
#
#     def process_sheet( sheet ):
#         counts= defaultdict( int )
#         for row in sheet.rows():
#             #\ *row is a sequence of* Cell *instances*
#             print( repr(c) for c in row )
#             counts['read'] += 1
#         return counts
#
# Ultimately, the sequence nature of a row is unsatisfying.   We'll have to
# wait until :ref:`schema` to extend this into something useful.
#
# Sheet Identification
# =====================
#
# For CSV and TAB files, as well as COBOL and Flat files, there is one anonymous
# "sheet" that is the entire workbook.
#
# For XLS, XLSX, and ODS formats, however, there are sheets within the workbook.
#
# For Numbers, there are "pages" or "workspaces" that have multiple tables. Each
# Numbers **table** is -- effectively -- a :py:class:`sheet.Sheet`. The
# intermediate organization level, "workspace", is an additional detail.
#
# We handle this in the following way.
#
# -   One anonymous sheet has a name either of ``None`` or the basename of the file.
#
# -   Simple sheets have names which are simple strings.
#
# -   Numbers workspaces with sheets have names which are two-tuples of 
#     workspace ("sheet") and table name.

# Row Class
# =============
#
# ..  py:class:: Row
#
#     A single row in Sheet; a sequence of :py:class:`cell.Cell` instances.
#
#     A Sheet produces this simple row-as-list.  A Schema can transform this
#     into row-as-dict or some even more elaborate structure.
#
#     A row depends on details of an :py:class:`schema.Attribute` 
#     and a :py:class:`workbook.base.Workbook`.  
#     This feels circular. But this Sheet/Row schema definition is really
#     just a convenient wrapper around the Workbook details.
#
#     The :py:class:`cell.Cell` conversions are handled by the :py:class:`workbook.base.Workbook`.
#     Some Workbooks have cell content identified by position.
#     Some Workbooks have cell content identified by size, offset and encoding.
#     Therefore, we must provide the Attribute details to the Workbook
#     to get the Cell's value.

# Note that the presumption in this interface is that the Attribute is
# sufficiently detailed to specify a single :py:class:`cell.Cell`.
# For non-COBOL workbooks, this is perfectly true.
#
# For COBOL, however, there are groups and occurs clauses, meaning that a single Attribute can
# represent multiple :py:class:`cell.Cell` instances.  
# Which one do we mean?  And how do we specify this selection?
#
# -   The :py:meth:`sheet.Row.cell` method can return a structure with all the values. 
#     Ordinary Python can then pick apart the instances.
#     This requires working up the DDE hierarchy to locate all of the applicable
#     "occurs" by to construct the proper dimensionality of an attribute.
#
#     It also means getting all of the values to create a tuple or nested
#     tuple-of-tuple structure for the various dimensions. Eager processing isn't
#     going to work out well.
#
# -   The :py:class:`schema.Attribute.index` method
#     selects data from the row in the workbook.  This applies the indices
#     to the Attribute to compute the required offset into the source data.
#   
#     We're constrained by the laziness requirement of COBOL to lean toward the 
#     this implementation.
#

#
#     When we can't eagerly build all :py:class:`cell.Cell` instances for a given

#     aliases for an attribute.  Also, there's no formal ``NULL`` value in COBOL, so

#
#     Further, we may have Occurs Depending On. This means we can't set size and
#     offset until we can access actual data.

# Rows of a Sheet
# ==================

# Note that the :py:mod:`csv` design pattern for each row involves two subclasses

# returns a ``dict`` of cells, keyed by field names, the other returns a ``list`` of cells,
# indexed by position.
#
# The dict-based processing has the advantage of clarity: cells are named row['cell'].  
# It has the disadvantage of not coping well with duplicate column names or data
# which breaks first normal form.
#
# We can't follow the :mod:`csv` design pattern.  Instead we do the following.
#
# -   A :py:class:`sheet.Row` is a sequence of :py:class:`cell.Cell` instances.
#     It may be lazy or it may be eager.
#
# -   To use names, a :py:class:`schema.Schema` must be used to fetch :py:class:`cell.Cell` 
#     instances from the :py:class:`sheet.Row` object. The schema translates names to positions.
#
# -   To create dict-like access to :py:class:`cell.Cell`  instances, 
#     the :py:class:`schema.Schema` can be turned into a dictionary.  The row itself
#     is not a dictionary, just the schema. The row is still a Sequence.
#   
#     This "schema-as-dict" can still be used with a properly
#     lazy :py:class:`sheet.Row` to create :py:class:`cell.Cell` instances.
#
# We need the lazy evaluation of a row that fetches data based on :py:class:`schema.Attribute`
# details in order to cope with COBOL ``REDEFINES``.  It also allows us to cope
# with the unfortunately common problem of duplicate column names in conventional
# spreadsheets.
#
# We can have application programming which looks like this to process a
# Row as sequence:
#
# ..  parsed-literal::
#
#     for row in sheet.rows():
#         row[i] # instance of Cell
#         sheet.schema[i].name # name attribute of Schema Attribute
#
# Row as dict is a common alternative.  If we have unique column names in the schema,
# We can than use application programming that looks like this.
#
# ..  parsed-literal::
#
#     schema_dict = dict((a.name, a) for a in sheet.schema)
#     for row in sheet.rows():
#         row.cell(schema_dict['name']) # instance of Cell
#         row_as_dict= dict(
#             (a.name, row.cell(a)) for a in sheet.schema)
#         row_as_dict['name'] # instance of Cell
#
# This handles the COBOL case, where rows must be lazy.
# This includes the ``REDEFINES`` and occurs clauses. 
# This assures proper packed decimal conversion of redefined fields.
