# COBOL Definitions Module -- Handle COBOL DDE's
# #######################################################
#
# ..  py:module:: cobol.defs
#
# This is a small set of class definitions and functions
# that are used by :py:mod:`cobol.loader` as well as 
# :py:mod:`cobol`.
#
# The intent of this module is to avoid a few circular import dependencies.
#
# The Architecture Problem
# ========================
#
# We have an issue of separation of three concerns:
#
# -   The underlying workbook and the parsing of CSV or XML or EBCDIC.
#     This is the Physical Format.
#
# -   The logical layout or schema we're imposing on the workbook's data.
#
# -   The process of loading a schema, possibly using a meta-workbook.
#     This includes the translation of COBOL notation into a useful schema.
#
# Except for COBOL, a schema depends on a meta-workbook via a schema loader. 
# But this is the limit of the relationship. We could say 
#
# ..    math::
#
#     S = L(w)
#    
# Or ``schema= loader(workbook)``. This may involve a separate workbook file,
# a separate sheet within a file or even just columns within 
# the current sheet.
#
# For COBOL, we'd like to keep schema, schema loader and workbook separate, also,
# even though COBOL code doesn't depend on COBOL data files.
# We'd still like to say ``schema= loader(cobol source)``. 
#
# ..    math::
#
#     S = L(c)
#
# We can imagine that an application will import a workbook class and a schema loader class.
# It will load the schema, then open the workbook using the schema.
#
# **However**.
#
# A COBOL schema with an occurs depending on (i.e. a DDE with ``variably_located == True``)
# will have the schema depending on each row in addition to the overall loading.
#
# We're really taking about a Baseline Schema, :math:`S_b`, and a Row-Level Schema, :math:`S_r`,
# that is built by resolving any Occurs Depending On
#
# ..    math::
#
#     S_b = L(c)
#
# ..    math::
#
#     s_r = R( d, S_b )
#    
# We've changed ``schema_baseline= loader(cobol source)`` and then,
# for each row, ``schema_row= setSizeAndOffset(data, schema_baseline)``.
#
# Where To Recompute
# ---------------------
#
# The fundamental issue is this: when can we recompute the offsets? 
#
# The choices for computing the offsets are these:
#
# -   At :py:meth:`COBOL_File.rows_of` time -- eagerly, but in the wrong module.
#     See below.
#
# -   At :py:meth:`COBOL_File.row_get` time -- a bit more lazy, but still in the wrong
#     module, since it's here, not in :py:mod:`cobol.loader`.
#    
# -   In the application before doing any schema processing on a given row. Very lazy.
#     But now the application must be more deeply involved in ODO processing. The application
#     would do something like the following. Sadly, it has a line that's easy to overlook.
#    
# ..  parsed-literal::
#    
#     with open("xyzzy.cob") as source:
#         dde_list, schema = COBOL_schema( source )
#     with stingray.cobol.Character_File( filename, schema=schema ) as wb:
#         sheet= wb.sheet( filename )
#         for row in sheet.rows():
#             **cobol.loader.setSizeAndOffset( dde_list[0] )**
#             dump( dde_list[0], row )
#            
# The Module Dependency Problem
# -------------------------------
#
# The :py:class:`Usage` class properly depends on :py:mod:`cobol`. 
# The :py:func:`cobol.loader.make_attr` function, also, properly depends on :py:mod:`cobol`.
#
# The idea is that workbooks are more fundamental than schema. We might need to use
# one workbook to build a schema to read another workbook. Schema are higher-level constructs.
#
# We want to avoid any circular dependency between :py:mod:`cobol.loader` referring
# back to :py:mod:`cobol`. 
# The :py:class:`schema.RepeatingAttribute` definition has a weak version of this undesirable. 
# dependency.  We finesse it
# by defining a bunch of properties that exploit the underlying DDE details without
# an explicit ``import`` of the DDE class.
#
# To assure that ``cobol`` does not depend on ``cobol.loader``,
# we'd have the class  :py:class:`schema.RepeatingAttribute` entirely built without
# reference to the base DDE. 
# This, however, means that we would effectively clone
# the hierarchical relationships into the :py:class:`schema.RepeatingAttribute` objects.
# Why bother?
#
# If we extend :py:meth:`COBOL_File.rows_of` or :py:meth:`COBOL_File.row_get`, we
# exacerbates the problem because it would introduce a circular ``import``. This 
# would make ``cobol`` depend on ``cobol.loader`` explicitly.
#
# Resolution
# --------------
#
# The ``setSizeAndOffset()`` function as well as a few other
# post-processing functions belong in an intermediate module that both ``cobol``
# and ``cobol.loader`` depend on. 
#
# Specifically, Cell definitions, DDE definitions, and the related functions required
# to build schema attributes from DDE's.
#
# That way, ``cobol`` can import ``cobol.defs.setSizeAndOffset``.
#
# Also, ``cobol.loader`` can import ``cobol.defs.DDE``.
#
# And ``cobol.RepeatingAttribute`` can depend on ``cobol.defs.DDE``.

#
# Cell Subclasses and Conversions
# =================================
#
# Rather than tinker too much with the :py:mod:`cell` module,

# and COMP-3 data.  
#
# There are three relevant features.
#
# -   Proper conversion from source characters or bytes.
#
# -   Preservation of the source characters (or bytes) for creating
#     character-level (or byte-level) structured dumps of a record.
#    
# -   Preservation of the original DDE attributes, because there is so much
#     information required to interpret the bytes.
#    
# Consequently, even the :py:class:`cell.TextCell` must be extended to include
# preservation of raw data.
#
# Further, we have a distinction between text and numbers which are

# Essential Class Definitions
# ============================
#    
# The essential class definitions define the DDE we're attempting to build.
# We can  separated this structure into a few high-level subject areas:
#
# -   `Usage Strategy Hierarchy`_ defines the various 
#     kinds of USAGE options.
#
# -   `Allocation Strategy Hierarchy`_ defines the relationships among DDE's:
#     Predecessor/Successor, Group/Elementary or Redefines.
#    
# -   `Occurs Strategy Hierarchy`_ defines the Occurs options of
#     Default (no Occurs), simple Occurs, and more complex Occurs Depending On.
#    
# -   The `DDE Class`_ itself.
#
# Usage Strategy Hierarchy
# --------------------------
#
# The :py:class:`Usage` class combines information in the picture, usage, sign and synchronized clauses.
#
# The **Strategy** design pattern allows a DDE element to delegate 
# the :py:meth:`Usage.size` and :py:meth:`Usage.create_func()` operations to this class.
#
# The :py:meth:`Usage.size` method returns the number
# of bytes used by the data element. 
#
# -   For usage ``DISPLAY``, the size is computed directly from the picture clause.  
#
# -   For usage ``COMP``, the size is 2, 4 or 8 bytes based on the picture clause.
#
# -   For usage ``COMP-3``, the picture clause digits are packed two per byte  
#     with an extra half-byte for sign information. This must be rounded up.
#     COMP-3 fields often have an odd number of digits to reflect this.
#
# The :py:meth:`Usage.create_func()` method returns a :py:class:`cell.Cell` type 
# that should be built from the raw bytes.

# ..  important:: Dependencies between DDE and Attribute
#
#     An OCCURS is a feature of the DDE.
#     Data access, however, requires the :py:class:`schema.Attribute`.
#     There's no **direct** linkage from :py:class:`cobol.defs.DDE` to :py:class:`schema.Attribute`. 
#     There is linkage from :py:class:`schema.Attribute` to :py:class:`cobol.defs.DDE`. 
#    
#     It seems best to have Attribute independent of any particular 
#     source. A schema may not necessarily come from COBOL.
#    
#     However.
#    
#     To facilitate a DDE-oriented dump of raw data or specific fields of a COBOL
#     file, we include a :py:mod:`weakref` from the ``DDE`` to the ``Attribute`` created
#     from that DDE.

# DDE Class
# --------------
#
# ..  py:class:: DDE
#
# The :py:class:`DDE` class itself defines a single element (group or elementary) of a
# record.  There are several broad areas of functionality for a DDE:
# (1) construction, (2) reporting and decoration, (3) processing record data.
#
# The class definition includes the attributes determined at
# parse time, attributes added during decoration time and
# attributes used during decoration processing.
#
# As noted above, Group-level vs. Elementary-level *could* be separate subclasses of DDE.
# They aren't right now, since group-level items can be used in an application program
# like elementary items. 
#
# A group-level item contains subsidiary DDE's and has no PICTURE clause.
# An elementary-level DDE is defined by having a PICTURE clause.
#
# All group-level DDE's are effectively string-type data.
# An elementary-level DDE with a numeric PICTURE is numeric-type data.  It can
# be usage display or usage computational.  An elementary-level DDE with a string PICTURE is string-type data.
#
# Occurs and Redefines can occur at any level.  
#
# Each entry is defined by the following attributes:
#
# :level:
#     COBOL level number 01 to 49, 66 or 88.
# :myName:
#     COBOL variable name
# :occurs:
#     An instance of :py:class:`Occurs`.
#     the number of occurrences. The default is 1, which we call "format 0".
#     There are two defined formats: format 1 has a fixed number of occurrences;
#     format 2 is the Occurs Depending On with a variable number of occurrences.
# :picture:
#     the exploded picture clause, with ()'s expanded
# :initValue:
#     any initial value provided
# :allocation:
#     an instance of :py:class:`Allocation` used to compute the offset and total size.
# :usage:
#     an instance of :py:class:`Usage` to delegate data conversion properly.
#     The actual conversion is handled by the workbook.
# :contains:
#     the list of contained fields within a group
# :parent:
#     A weakref to the immediate parent DDE
# :top:
#     A weakref to the overall record definition DDE.
#    
# The following decorations are applied by functions that traverse the DDE structure.
#
# :sizeScalePrecision:
#     ``Picture`` namedtuple with details derived from parsing the PICTURE clause
# :size:
#     the size of an individual occurrence
#
# The following features may have to be computed lazily if there's an Occurs
# Depending On. Otherwise they can be computed eagerly.
#
# :variably_located:
#     Variably Located if any this element or any child has Occurs Depending On.
#     Otherwise (no ODO) the DDE is Statically Located.
#     Actually, only element **after** the ODO element are variably located. But it's simpler
#     to treat the whole record as variable.
# :offset:
#     offset to this field from start of record.
# :totalSize:
#     overall size of this item, including all occurrences.
#
# Additionally, this item -- in a way -- breaks the dependencies between
# a :py:class:`schema.Attribute` and a DDE. It's appropriate for an Attribute
# to depend on a DDE, but the reverse isn't proper. However, we DDE
# referring to an attribute anyway.
