# Workbook Base Definition
# ==========================
#
# These are the definitions shared by all Workbook subclass definitions.
#
# One of the common features is date conversions. Only XLS files have 
# peculiar date conversion issues. But we're forced to make all 
# spreadsheets polymorphic with respect to this anomalous behavior.
